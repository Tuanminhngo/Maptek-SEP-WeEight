**Labels:**
- `.` (space): 7,530,112 blocks (45%)
- `-` (mantle): 7,232,688 blocks (43%)
- `` ` `` (outer_core): 1,376,752 blocks (8%)
- `:` (atmosphere): 321,944 blocks (2%)
- `o` (ocean): 182,733 blocks (1%)
- `O` (continent): 62,091 blocks (<1%)

## Current Performance (MaxRectStrat)

**Compression:**
- Input blocks: 16,777,216
- Output blocks: 263,797
- **Compression ratio: 63.6x**
- **Size reduction: 98.43%**
- Processing time: 34 seconds

**Block Size Distribution:**
- 1×1×1 blocks: 50,297 (19% of output)
- <100 cell blocks: 201,186 (76% of output)
- ≥100 cell blocks: 12,314 (5% of output)
- Largest block: 41,984 cells (e.g., 32×32×41)

## Key Insights

1. **Spherical Structure:** The data represents a planet with concentric shells
   - Outer layers (space, atmosphere) have curved boundaries
   - Inner core has the most regular structure
   - Boundaries between layers create irregular shapes

2. **Compression Bottleneck:** Small blocks at layer boundaries
   - 50K single-cell blocks account for minimal volume but lots of overhead
   - These occur where curved surfaces don't align with rectangular blocks

3. **MaxRect Performance:** Already near-optimal for this type of data
   - Handles large uniform regions very well (99%+ compression on core)
   - Struggles with thin curved shells (atmosphere, ocean surface)

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. **Post-Processing Block Merging** ⭐ Best approach
Merge adjacent small blocks of the same label after initial compression.
- Target: Combine 1×1×1 blocks into larger rectangles where possible
- Expected improvement: 5-10% reduction in block count
- Complexity: O(n log n) where n = output blocks

### 2. **Adaptive Rectangle Selection**
Use different strategies for different labels based on their distribution.
- Space/Mantle: MaxRect (handles large volumes)
- Atmosphere/Ocean: Greedy or RLE (handles thin shells)
- Expected improvement: 3-5%

### 3. **Multi-Pass Compression**
First pass: MaxRect for large blocks
Second pass: Fill gaps with smaller blocks
- Expected improvement: 2-3%

### 4. **Machine Learning: NOT RECOMMENDED**
Reasons:
- No labeled training data available
- Inference would be too slow (current: 34s, ML: 5+ minutes)
- Non-deterministic results (not acceptable for compression)
- This is a combinatorial optimization problem, not a pattern recognition task

## Conclusion

**Current MaxRectStrat is already excellent** at 63.6x compression.
**Realistic improvement ceiling:** 68-72x compression (5-10% better)
**Diminishing returns:** Beyond 70x would require complex algorithms with minimal benefit

**Recommended next steps:**
1. Implement post-processing block merger
2. Test on competition grading system
3. Only pursue further optimization if competition requires it
