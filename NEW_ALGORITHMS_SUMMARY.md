## 🆕 New Algorithms Implemented

### 1. **LayeredSliceStrat** - Z-First Grouping
**Concept**: Hash each Z-slice, group identical consecutive slices, decompose once

**Best for**: Geological layers, building floors, stratified data

**Algorithm**:
```
1. For each Z-slice, compute hash of label pattern
2. Group consecutive slices with identical hash
3. Decompose unique slice pattern once using MaxRect
4. Emit rectangles with appropriate Z-depth
```

**Performance**: Same as existing (for this dataset)

---

### 2. **QuadTreeStrat** - Hierarchical Subdivision
**Concept**: Recursively split space into quadrants, merge uniform regions

**Best for**: Fractal patterns, hierarchical structures, varying scales

**Algorithm**:
```
1. Start with full XY region per Z-slice
2. If entire region is same label → emit single block
3. Else split into 4 quadrants
4. Recursively process each quadrant
5. Merge adjacent blocks in Z
```

**Performance**: Same as existing (for this dataset)

**Features**: Adaptive to data structure, logarithmic subdivision

---

### 3. **ScanlineStrat** - Sweep with Active Rectangles
**Concept**: Left-to-right sweep maintaining active vertical segments

**Best for**: Manhattan geometry, orthogonal boundaries, CAD-like data

**Algorithm**:
```
1. For each X column, find vertical runs
2. Sweep left to right
3. Try to extend existing rectangles
4. Emit rectangles that can't extend
5. Stack identical rectangles in Z
```

**Performance**: Same as existing (for this dataset)

**Features**: Good cache locality, streaming-friendly

---

### 4. **AdaptiveStrat** - Pattern-Based Selection
**Concept**: Analyze data characteristics, pick optimal strategy

**Best for**: Heterogeneous/mixed datasets

**Algorithm**:
```
Analyze data:
  - Density: labelCells / totalCells
  - Z-correlation: slice similarity

Decision tree:
  - If Z-correlation > 0.8 → LayeredSlice
  - Else if density > 0.5 → MaxRect
  - Else if density > 0.2 → QuadTree
  - Else → Greedy (fast)
```

**Performance**: Depends on data characteristics

**Features**: Intelligent strategy selection, no manual tuning

---

### 5. **Optimal3DStrat** (Already existed, now included)
**Concept**: Enhanced MaxRect with aggressive Z-stacking

**Best for**: 3D uniform regions, volumetric data

**Performance**: Already in use (part of best result)

## 🔧 SmartMergeStrat Evolution

### Before (3 strategies):
```cpp
1. MaxRect
2. Greedy
3. RLEXY
```

### After - Version 1 (8 strategies - TOO SLOW):
```cpp
1. MaxRect
2. Greedy
3. RLEXY
4. Optimal3D
5. LayeredSlice
6. QuadTree
7. Scanline
8. Adaptive
```
**Result**: 236,088 blocks in 4m 39s ❌

### After - Version 2 (5 strategies - OPTIMIZED):
```cpp
1. Optimal3D       ← Usually wins
2. LayeredSlice    ← Best for layered data
3. MaxRect         ← Best for uniform regions
4. Greedy          ← Fast fallback
5. Scanline        ← Good for Manhattan structures
```
**Result**: 236,088 blocks in 2m 32s ✅

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why Same Compression?
The new algorithms achieved the **same 236,088 blocks** because:
1. The "worldly_one" dataset is already well-suited to existing strategies
2. Optimal3D (now included) was likely already optimal
3. The dataset has mostly large uniform regions (MaxRect's strength)

### When Will New Algorithms Help?
The new algorithms will outperform on:
- **LayeredSlice**: Geological core samples, building CAD files
- **QuadTree**: Fractal terrain, procedurally generated worlds
- **Scanline**: City grids, circuit layouts, architectural plans
- **Adaptive**: Mixed datasets with varying characteristics

### Speed vs Coverage Trade-off
- **3 strategies**: Fast (35s), good coverage
- **5 strategies**: Medium (2m 32s), excellent coverage ⭐
- **8 strategies**: Slow (4m 39s), redundant coverage

## 🚀 Usage

### Use SmartMerge (Recommended)
```cpp
Strategy::SmartMergeStrat strat;
// Automatically tries 5 strategies and picks best
```

### Use Individual Algorithms
```cpp
// For layered geological data
Strategy::LayeredSliceStrat strat;

// For fractal/hierarchical data
Strategy::QuadTreeStrat strat;

// For Manhattan geometry
Strategy::ScanlineStrat strat;

// Let algorithm decide
Strategy::AdaptiveStrat strat;

// Maximum compression (very slow)
Strategy::MaxCuboidStrat strat;
```

| LayeredSlice | O(D × W×H) | O(W×H) | Layered data |
| QuadTree | O(D × W×H × log(W×H)) | O(W×H) | Hierarchical |
| Scanline | O(D × W×H) | O(W×H) | Manhattan |
| Adaptive | O(D × W×H) + strategy | O(W×H) | Mixed data |
| MaxCuboid | O(iterations × D² × W×H) | O(D×W×H) | Max compression |

Where: D=depth, W=width, H=height
