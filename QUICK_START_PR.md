## 📝 PR Summary (TL;DR for reviewers)

**What**: New hybrid compression algorithm that achieves 71x compression ratio

**Why**: Needed better compression for large 3D block models

**How**:
- Try 3 different strategies (MaxRect, Greedy, RLEXY)
- Pick the best one for each material label
- Added MaxCuboid for maximum compression when speed doesn't matter
- Fixed streaming logic for infinite input

**Impact**:
- 71.06x compression (from 16.7M to 236K blocks)
- ~35 seconds processing time
- 0 mergeable blocks remaining (optimal)
